# Typing Speed Test App

Welcome to Typing Speed Test project! This application is designed to allow users to measure and improve their typing speed and accuracy in a fun and interactive way. It's perfect for anyone looking to practice typing and track their progress over time.

## Project Overview

Typing Speed Test app retrieves a random quote from a public API, which users then has to type out within a 60-second time frame. The app evaluates the user's typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy, providing instant feedback by highlighting correct and incorrect inputs. Users can track their progress through data table.

- **Interactive Controls:** Supports the use of backspace for corrections, "enter" to restart the current test, and "esc" for a full reset with a new text prompt.
- **Metrics Visualization:** Showcases the user's typing metrics over time through tables or charts.
- **Performance Insights:** After each attempt, indicates whether the user has improved compared to last attempt.
- **Modular Code:** Utilizes module imports and exports for code organization.
